# Stepping away from GitHub

Over the past years, my relationship with GitHub and my code was a
wellunderstanding one. When I first started writing open source, back
then using entirely different aliases (so no, you won't find my old old
code), GitLab was the friendly one.

GitLab offered free stuff that GitHub did not yet.

Over time this changed, and so did my preference.

Now, my hand feels forced into tech I am not looking to expand. My
preference has to change once again.

## Microsoft takeover

A few years ago GitHub was acquired by Microsoft, many people feared of
what was coming, but I told them: "GitHub remains in control, nothing
will change."

How naive.

As the GitHub CEO stepped down recently, Microsoft took it's chance...
\..and now who manages GitHub?

Not _just Microsoft_. Microsoft's *AI TEAM*. GitHub is apparently no
longer a VCS remote. It's an AI thing entirely.

## LLM's

I'm not against any form of large language models, and the usage of AI
outside of generative is actually something I enjoy seeing grow.

But keep those LLM's in their lane. Which is text generation and
prediction, code is text. Fine. However _my code_ is not it's lane. My
code, is mine.

Yes, yes. It's open source yadda yadda yadda. If you drag out that
argument I'm closing it.

I'm okay with LLM's, I'm not okay with GitHub being an LLM thing.
Because my code is not just an LLM thing.

> _{*Also, generative AI is boring!*}_

## Where do I go?

I won't disappear off GitHub, I've already got a small presence on
Codeberg and currently mirror that to GitHub, those mirror's will stop.

I will spread my eggs into multiple baskets, I've created an [tangled.sh
account](https://tangled.sh/@strawmelonjuice.com) and will soon host my
own  Forgejo instance, with runners.

{*I'll create README's redirecting you to the new locations! :3*}

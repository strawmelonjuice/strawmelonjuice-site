# What does this folder do?

This folder holds a few files Cynthia Mini serves to the browser to make sure everything works alright.

These are usually checked and downloaded if necessary only during start of the server,
so try not to touch them! If you believe one of the files in here might be faulty, delete it, and restart the server.

Have a nice day! :)

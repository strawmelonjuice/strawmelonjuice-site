# About me
Hello, I'm Mar! I'm a 20-year-old student from The Netherlands, waitress, music enjoyer, addict to creativity, writer and more.

Wait, you'll understand after you know what my favourite quote is:

> <div>If there&#x2019;s a book that you want to read, but it hasn&#x2019;t been written yet, then you must write it.</div>
> 
> <div>&#x2015; Toni Morrison</div>

So I do. Question is: Will I ever finish writing and publish something?

> Optimist, emotional human, writer, actual witch sometimes, (cool) person, weirdo, me.
> 
> <div>&#x2015; Me</div>

This site no longer runs on WordPress, this is how and why I did it.

## Instability

WordPress has been known for its user-friendlyness and plug&play for the past years, however, maybe due to Automattic pushing it to their host-as-a-service thing... It is feeling less and less stable on my self-hosted setup, especially when tweaking it.

## Corruption

Updates are necessary, especially on a huge and well-known web-faced piece of software like WordPress, though by running update over update, it seemed data got overwritten or even corrupted, and the past 1.5 years the site went down multiple times. Every single time right after an update.

## Simple, yet more my way

I also wanted to get something more in my themes, instead of having to edit an existing theme template. Additionally, the WordPress editor is jam-full of functions, and I love it. However I don't need all that when posting simple messages like this one! MarkDown is a fine way of creating posts, and (currently typing from Typora) it's just plain text, _`unless you want to make it complicated by adding HTML`_, it's great. Simple, but great.

### "Ephew"

My solution to the problems I had? Initially none. Until I scrolled through older projects. "Ephew", the code name for an old social media platform concept, has served me earlier. Ephew as a project, was an absolute mess. But it had so many reusable components that it had helped me out with creating [Logger-Diary Online](https://logger-diary.strawmelonjuice.com/) earlier, and throwing a selection of its code into my VSCode made me built up a new way of approaching my site: It's just a static site anyways.

So, here we are. On a static page, served from static files!

## Hello new site

Anyways, this site it not by any means finished. As a matter of fact, the site won't know in what order the post should be shown (working on that right now!), but for this post... I think we did fairly well! See you at the next post?

# Strawmelonjuice's list of web sites

Based on seeing the internet freedom and safety going downhill I decided to start a list of sites and my classification  of them. If you want to edit this list, [send a PR on GitHub](https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/strawmelonjuice.dev/edit/main/cynthiaFiles/pages/listofsites.md) or [email me](mailto:mar@strawmelonjuice.com).

<div class="centered"><a href="https://github.com/strawmelonjuice/strawmelonjuice.dev/edit/main/cynthiaFiles/pages/listofsites.md"><button class="huge-button">Propose a change <img src="/assets/img/svg/github-mark.svg" height="20px" class="svgrecolor" alt="GitHub"></button></a></div>

### Code of conduct
> 1. `Proposals for reclassification of sites is allowed for sites already in the lists, not for sites not yet classified.`
> 2. `New sites to be added should be at the end of the "Uncategorized" list.`
> 3. `A site joining a list, either as a new site, or from moving, should be put at the bottom of that list.`


This list has 5 categories. 
1. Uncategorized
2. Safe (for now)
3. Be careful
4. Unsafe
5. Best to stay away

They're pretty self-explanatory, however some explanations are added atop the list and behind or below individual site names.

## Uncategorized
Sites that haven't been classified by me (strawmelonjuice), you should add new sites here.

- <https://reddit.com/>: `Initial submission. Will file these later.` - `15/3/2024`


## Safe (for now)
Sites that seem to respect their users, and be safe.

- 

## Be careful
These sites have had some worrysome recent developments or a shady past. Be careful here.
- > <https://tumblr.com/> - `16/3/2024`
  > - Recent ongoing capitalisation of parts of the website
  > - Doesn't verify nor moderate outside sources well (Tumblr Live, The external mod-team-transmisogyny)
  > - Has a transphobic CEO (Matt Mullenweg)



## Unsafe
These sites are generally not the ones you will want to rely on. You can use them, but again, be careful.

- > <https://x.com/>, <https://twitter.com/> - `18/3/2024`
  >
  > - Elon Musk has taken it over, immediately calling for a purge of "extreme leftism"
  > - Doesn't moderate hate speech, instead marks it as free speech
  > - Inconsistent (unfair) moderation
  > - Hypercapitalisation, pay-to-moderate
  > - Privacy hazard (tracking)



## Best to stay away
These sites are just hot garbage. Stay away or get burned from them. Watch out.

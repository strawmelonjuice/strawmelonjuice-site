  title: "Logger-Diary Online: Update summary for summer '23!"
  short: Loads of updates coming to Logger-Diary.Online users in the past two months, most of them small enough to go unnoticed. However, I’ll make a small and comprehensible list so they won’t actually go unnoticed!

    A misunderstanding! Will the bunny-thing eat the mole-thing? I think they'll become friends.

    My site now has a cat following your mouse around. 
    The kitten will only follow you on pages of the type 'base', so not on blog pages or pages that are set to be a different type.
    
    I think it's cute.

    Edit: The filters were also broken for a rlly long time! They work now without screwing up the page, and remember your setting for 30 days across pages! UwU

  title: Leafornia’s travels - chapter two
  short: Today went bad. I underestimated how hard it is for me to live here. Physically, I am weaker than my lost demon. However, I don’t know if this world didn’t mess him up mentally. I also need to take in consideration that my normal me is weak in this world, and that my powers are way too strong for this world. I may no longer use my powers if unnecessarily. Regards from earth.

  title: Leafornia’s travels - chapter one
  short: “No, I beg you! I’ll do my best next time, I’ll make sure your fire is as hot as you want it! Please!” She sat back in her red velvet throne, looking him dead in the eye, making clear that his begging made no sense to her. “You foolish giant demon. I do not see why I should spare you, for it is only one human life, and you did not quite do as you promised last time.”, she spoke. “And no. I do not care about the temperature of my fire, it is only for decoration. I’ll just send you there because that’s what I do, no reason behind it.”
